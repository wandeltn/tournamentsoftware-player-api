# Tournament API

This module is for fetching data from the tournament website to get player information. 

The whole interface of this module is very straightforward and probably needs no docs.
The Parameter needed from all getter functions is the content that should be inserted
into the searchbar on the website.

## Caution!

If you need multiple datapoints from the api, please use the more general function
`getPlayerDetails`, because otherwise this will result in multiple calls to the api
and possibly a rate limit. Most users don't need to worry about this, as the function 
is exported as default.
